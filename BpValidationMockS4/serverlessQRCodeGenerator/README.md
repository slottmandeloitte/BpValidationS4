Login to Business Application Studio

Enable "Extension Factory Serverless Runtime Development" while creating dev space in BizAppStudio.

```bash
cf login -u 'inumber' -p 'passowrd'
```
 
create xfsrt service instance: 
```bash
cf create-service xfs-runtime default extension -c '{\"extensions\": true, \"odp\": true}'
```

create service key for the xfsrt instance : 
```bash
cf create-service-key <XFSRT_SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME> <XFSRT_SERVICE_KEY_NAME>
```

Create EM service key
```bash
cf create-service-key <EVENT_MESH_SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME> <EVENT_MESH_SERVICE_KEY_NAME>
```

Create destination service service - key
```bash
cf create-service-key <DESTINATION_SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME> <DESTINATION_SERVICE_KEY_NAME>
```

Login to Serverless instance
```bash
xfsrt-cli login -k <serverless_instance_key_name> -n <service_instance_name>
```

Register Event Mesh Service instance
```bash
xfsrt-cli faas service register -b <Event_Mesh_service_key_name> -s <service_name>
```

Register Destination Service instance
```bash
xfsrt-cli faas service register -b <Destination_service_key_name> -s <service_name>
```

move to project. cd serverlessQRCodeGenerator

Install faas-sdk
```bash
npm install @sap/faas -g
```

Install all required node packages
```bash
npm install
```

First, create a deployment file to provide credentials. Run inside the project directory:
```bash
faas-sdk init-values -y values.yaml
```

Login to BTP cockpit and create a destination
 1. url : using service url from registered odata service
 2. Type: HTTP
 3. Authentication: oAuth2ClientCredentials
 4. clientId : <client Id of xfsrt service instance>
 5. clientSecret: <clientSecret of xfsrt service instance>
 6. Token Service URL: <Token URL from xfsrt service instance>

update values.yaml file with the below values
- Type, instance and key from the details of registered Enterprise Messaging Service and Destination Service. Execute the below command to get the details.
  ```bash
  xfsrt-cli faas service list
  ```
- Update the Name of the destination under secret-values -> destinationname -> name -> name 
- Also update attachmentSrvApi as API_CV_ATTACHMENT_SRV
  businessPartnerSrvApi as API_BUSINESS_PARTNER
  businessObjectTypeName as BUS1006
  under secret-values -> destinationname -> name -> name
- Update the Enterprise messaging queue name under config-values-section -> amqp-service-config -> amqp -> incoming -> inp1 -> sourceAddress appended with "queue:<your queue name>"

And finally run the below command inside the project directory to deploy the project
```bash
 xfsrt-cli faas project deploy -y ./deploy/values.yaml
```
